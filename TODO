Features
========

* download several files and merge them (e.g. Austria, Czech and Germany)

* Add Bugs from openstreetbugs (http://openstreetbugs.schokokeks.org/dumps/osbdump_latest.sql.bz2)

* fetch topographic contour lines and integrate it in the final map

Improvements
============

* have a try on OSM-history-splitter (should be able to crop data faster than osmosis)

* mkgmap can read with the argument -c from a config file. Using this would allow to loop over all available configs instead of having several similar sections for each (basemap, bikemap, pkwmap) map in make.sh


Stability
=========

* check if all filenames are quoted (therefore, if spaces in path are allowed)

* several problems if script is continued after it was aborted with CTRL-C (return values are not evaluated). This problem can be treated with state files
