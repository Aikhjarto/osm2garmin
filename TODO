Bugs
====
* If a building is tagged with hotel and restaurant, it'll only show up as hotel in the navi's POI search.

Features
========

* download several files and merge them (e.g. Austria, Czech and Germany)

* fetch topographic contour lines and integrate it in the final map (srmt2osm is outdated any cannot crop along polygon; phyghtmap has lots of unresolved dependencies in OpenSuSe 12.3)

Improvements
============
* support input parameters rather than configuring by commenting codelines

* have a separate tmp folder for each map set

* have a try on OSM-history-splitter (should be able to crop data faster than osmosis; has a lot of unresolved dependencies on openSuSe 12.3)

* mkgmap can read with the argument -c from a config file. Using this would allow to loop over all available configs instead of having several similar sections for each (basemap, bikemap, pkwmap) map in make.sh

* treat warnings of "rm" when purging already existing temporary folders

* provide more style and TYP files

* check out mkgmaps new (around r2500+) support for overview-maps

* basemap shows some overview housenumbers. Move them completely to address layer.

Stability and Compatibility
===========================

* check if all filenames are quoted (therefore, if spaces in path are allowed). There is a problem with the -c options of mkgmap and filename quotes. See make.sh for comments

* several problems if script is continued after it was aborted with CTRL-C (return values are not evaluated). This problem can be treated with state files

* check what happens if one part of [ $1 -nt $2 ] is empty or missing

* script cannot run in cygwin since the windows version of java cannot handle unix-style filenames
