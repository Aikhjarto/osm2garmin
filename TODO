Features
========

* download several files and merge them (e.g. Austria, Czech and Germany)

* Add Bugs from openstreetbugs (http://openstreetbugs.schokokeks.org/dumps/osbdump_latest.sql.bz2)

* fetch topographic contour lines and integrate it in the final map

Improvements
============

* have a try on OSM-history-splitter (should be able to crop data faster than osmosis)

* mkgmap can read with the argument -c from a config file. Using this would allow to loop over all available configs instead of having several similar sections for each (basemap, bikemap, pkwmap) map in make.sh

* treat warnings of "rm" when purging already existing temporary folders

* provide more style and TYP files

Stability
=========

* check if all filenames are quoted (therefore, if spaces in path are allowed). There is a problem with the -c options of mkgmap and filename quotes. See make.sh for comments

* several problems if script is continued after it was aborted with CTRL-C (return values are not evaluated). This problem can be treated with state files

* check what happens if one part of [ $1 -nt $2 ] is empty or missing
